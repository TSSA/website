About TSSA:
 we are a non-governmental, non-profit, non-religious and non-political student organisation that helps medical students find ways to be more effective in the society they are living in.
 we help improve the medical education, community and public health through committees that handle each aspect independantly from, but in collaboration with, other committees.
